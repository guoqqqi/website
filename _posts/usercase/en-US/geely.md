**Editor's note: The extraordinary year 2020 accelerates the digital transformation of global enterprises, of which cloud-native has become a key driver. Zhiliu Technology and Geely cooperate to realize the centralized management, visualization and security of APIs, laying the foundation for Geely's next "10 million vehicles" era.**

In 2020, global enterprises will accelerate their digital transformation and their business models are changing. All walks of life are following the trend, optimizing processes, improving working methods, increasing productivity, and stimulating innovation. Digital technology is being integrated into all areas of the enterprise, completely subverting the original collaboration method, improving efficiency, stimulating driving force, and assisting enterprises to explore new models and discover new values.

## Technology innovation for business growth

On August 10, the 2020 《Fortune》 Global 500 officially announced that Geely Holding Group ranked 243rd with USD 47.8 billion (approximately RMB 330.8 billion) in revenue.

This is the ninth consecutive year that Geely Holdings has been ranked among the 《Fortune》 500, and the only Chinese private auto group to make the list. Since Geely Holdings Group acquired Volvo Cars, Geely and Volvo have strengthened their cooperation in R&D, procurement, powertrain, manufacturing and other areas, achieving fruitful results and laying a solid foundation for the sustainable and healthy development of both parties, and becoming a model of synergistic development in the industry.

In 2019, the cumulative sales of various brands under Geely Holdings exceeded 2.17 million. Ranked No. 1 in sales of Chinese brand passenger cars for three consecutive years; global sales have set a new high for six consecutive years.

Geely's rapid development is due to continuous technological innovation. The current technological innovation represented by 5G, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, big data and cloud-native is driving the digital transformation of the automotive industry. Geely has taken the initiative to meet the challenges and grasp the historical opportunities in recent years, insisting on high level of R&D innovation investment, over 100 billion in R&D in ten years, driving the technological transformation with R&D innovation, and continuing to lead the technological transformation of Chinese brand cars.

## API to help digital transformation

Geely's solid information construction is behind the Group's high business growth. At present, Geely Automobile Group has thousands of business systems and the number of interfaces is also increasing. How to manage the existing systems in a unified and efficient way and how to open the interfaces to provide greater value to the outside world are the main problems faced at present.

The traditional approach is to partially interface between projects according to their own needs, so that the interface is very targeted, and does not have the generality to support new needs, this point-to-point approach, although the use of API, but not the formation of API ecology. This point-to-point approach, although using the API, does not form an API ecosystem. Often the design is repeated and developed again, lengthening the project schedule.

Geely Group chose to integrate mature APIs to improve efficiency, and changed the way of docking by opening APIs and breaking through the limitations of the enterprise's old system. From the traditional point-to-point docking to self-service docking. Turning APIs into platforms and markets.

A market that carries a large number of APIs of the group requires a powerful, safe and reliable API gateway. The APISEVEN high-performance Cloud Native API Gateway developed by Zhiliu Technology provides refined routing and full dynamic update capabilities, and its performance is far ahead of the same type of products. It supports various types of protection, operation and maintenance in security assurance. Friendly, detailed documentation and low-threshold customizable capabilities have won Geely's favor.

## Simple and efficient, not afraid of challenges

APISEVEN is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway based on the Apache Foundation's top-level project APISIX implementation, providing rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, grayscale publishing, service meltdown, authentication, observability, and more.

The data plane and control plane of the APISEVEN gateway are separated. The configuration of the control plane and the business flow of the data plane do not affect each other, and the configuration is synchronized dynamically.

APISEVEN adopts a high-availability architecture by default, based on ETCD clusters for storage and distribution. It has no state management, supports horizontal expansion, and has no single point of failure.

APISEVEN supports service traffic refinement control, which can not only distinguish traffic with different characteristics at the route matching stage, but also send a specified percentage of traffic to back-end services based on custom rules.

For example, the Geely API market needs to distinguish the traffic distribution of the same API under different versions. After determining the specific version of the API, it still needs to control the traffic finely to the specified copy. APISEVEN gateway supports free combination of rules in different matching stages to meet various complex grayscale requirements.

Specific grayscale control policies are Canary, Blue-Green, AB testing, etc. Meet Gili's daily multi-version deployment and specific traffic control needs. Plus some interface design to make daily use easier.

To ensure the normal operation of the API marketplace and reduce the impact of abnormal traffic on the API marketplace, APISEVEN provides cluster-level flow restriction, which can be freely configured according to the granularity of cluster, service, and consumer.

Operations friendly, APISEVEN supports Prometheus, SkyWalking dynamic tracing, traffic replication, fault injection and more.

These features of the APISEVEN gateway perfectly meet the needs of the Geely API market. Through centralized configuration, the internal API of the enterprise is managed uniformly, coupled with multi-version management and permission control, which supports developers to quickly launch services and APIs, and facilitate users to subscribe to services of interest. While changing the configuration quickly, it does not affect the normal operation of business traffic and reduces development and subscription costs.

## Geely and Zhiliu Technology work together to create the future

APISEVEN Cloud Native API Gateway developed by Shenzhen Tributary is designed to help enterprises and organizations build and run loosely coupled systems that are elastic and scalable, fault-tolerant, easy to manage and easy to observe in new dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds. Combined with reliable automation, it enables developers to easily make frequent and predictable changes to their systems.

In the context of digital transformation, Geely, guided by the vision of "Let the world be filled with Geely", is practicing its internal strength, putting users at the center, pushing China's manufacturing industry into the API economy, transforming into a technology-based enterprise, and reshaping the global manufacturing landscape. Tributary Technology will also use its technical advantages and professional knowledge to help Geely Group to lay a good foundation for the next "10 million vehicles" and let users feel the quality charm of Geely Made in China.
